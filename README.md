# nonlinear-fits
Experiment with non linear curve fitting by leasts squares and derivatives


The idea is, take some set of data, assume that it can be modeled by a
function. Assume that function, and for this example, assume x^2. 



Just something.  Trying out githubs new editor.
Can it do images?
